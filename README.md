Project Overview
This project aims to centralise the sales data of a multinational retail company. Previously dispersed across multiple sources, this data will now reside in a single database for easier access and analysis, supporting the company's data-driven decision-making processes.

Key Objectives
Data Centralisation:
Consolidate sales data from multiple sources into a centralised database.
Ensure data consistency and act as the single source of truth.

Data Querying:
Enable efficient querying of the database to provide up-to-date business metrics.
Features

Data Storage: Utilises PostgreSQL for secure, scalable, and reliable storage of sales data.
Centralised Access: All sales data accessible from a single location.

Data Queries: Supports querying for key business metrics such as:
Total sales per region or product category
Performance trends over time
Real-time business insights
